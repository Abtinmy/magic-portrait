     This method minimizes the squared error terms of image gradients and a vector guidance field. The optimization 
     is subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions which fix intensities at mask borders.
     
     If the vector guidance field is the gradient of the foreground image, then the solution is given by
        Laplacian(result) = divergence(gradient(foreground)) s.t. boundary conditions.
     
     Depending on the vector guidance field differents blend effects can be generated.
